# Value of EDA
- Validate data and make sure it is free of error and anamalies. 
- Find insight about this data set. 
- Select and manipulate features for machine learning model. 

The goal of this is to ensure that the data is ready to be used in a machine learning algorithm. 

# Normal things that could be done. 
- Check missing value by using missingno library. 
- Draw correlation heatmap: how strongly the presence or absence of one variable affects the other. 
- Draw dendrogram to measure correlation between all variables. 
- Pair plot, draw correlation between target variables with other variables.
